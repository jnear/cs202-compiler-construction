# Assignment 1

**Solve the exercises in a single Racket source file, and submit your
  file on the course Blackboard under "Assignment 1".**

**Due: Monday, Jan 28, 11:59pm**

1. Solve *Exercise 1* from the course textbook, on page 15. Implement
your partial evaluator in a function called `pe-R0`.

2. Write 10 test cases for the partial evaluator you implemented for
exercise 1. Construct your test cases so that pressing the "run"
button in DrRacket runs your tests. I suggest (but do not require)
using `rackunit` as we did in class.
